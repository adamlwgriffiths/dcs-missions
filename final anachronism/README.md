# Final Anachronism

Similar concept to the movie "The Final Countdown".
Modern task group finds itself brought back to WW2.

## TODO:

* Fix the E2-D not spawning.
* Fix the S-3B tanker not spawning.
* Fix the CAP RTB'ing immediately.
* Make first wave bomb things properly (groups bomb one at a time in DCS...)
* Make first wave retreat after N% losses.
* Spawn second wave 15m after retreat/destruction of first.
* Spawn third wave in similar fashion, but attack the naval yards.
* Add more spawns for non-carrier vehicles
